# Leaderboard Submission Guide

Submit your agent results to the τ-bench leaderboard at **[taubench.com](https://taubench.com)**.

| Modality | Description | Guide |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Text** | Standard text-based half-duplex evaluation | [Text: Run & Prepare](#text-run-evaluations-and-prepare-submission) |
| **Voice** | Audio-native full-duplex evaluation (τ-voice) | [Voice: Run & Prepare](#voice-run-evaluations-and-prepare-submission) |

Both modalities share the same [validation](#step-3-validate-your-submission), [directory setup](#step-4-create-your-submission-directory), [manifest update](#step-5-update-the-manifest), and [PR submission](#step-6-submit-pull-request) steps.

---

## Requirements

Your submission should meet these constraints:

1. **Domain coverage** — we recommend including results for all current text domains (`banking_knowledge`, `retail`, `airline`, `telecom`). You may submit results for a single domain; the leaderboard ranks submissions per domain.
2. **Consistent model configuration** — all trajectory files must use the same agent model and user simulator with identical arguments across all domains
3. **One result per domain** — each domain should appear exactly once
4. **All tasks completed** — run evaluation on all tasks within each domain (don't use `--task-ids` or `--num-tasks` filters)
5. **4+ trials** — we strongly prefer results with at least 4 trials per domain for statistical reliability
6. **Voice only: "regular" speech complexity** — voice submissions must use `--speech-complexity regular` (not "control"). Voice submissions typically only report Pass^1 scores since multi-trial evaluation with audio-native models is expensive; higher Pass^k values may be `null`.

> **Note**: Use the `base` task split (default) when evaluating your agent to ensure you're testing on the complete, standard task set consistent with the original τ-bench methodology.

## Submission Types: Standard vs Custom

The leaderboard distinguishes between two types of submissions:

### Standard Submissions (Default)

Standard submissions use the documented default **benchmark-side evaluation
setup** for their modality. The model or system being evaluated is treated as
the product behind its agent interface; its internal implementation does not
determine the submission type.

All standard submissions use:

- The standard task set, domain policies, tools, and evaluator
- The default user simulator and evaluation protocol for the track
- No benchmark-side prompt, tool, orchestration, task-selection, or grading
  modifications
- No access to hidden task goals, reference actions, evaluator state, or other
  benchmark data outside the standard agent interface
- A model or system that was not trained specifically on τ-bench tasks,
  rewards, or evaluation data

#### Text τ-bench

A standard text submission evaluates a general-purpose LLM through the default
τ-bench agent scaffold, with the standard tool set and prompts. Replacing or
augmenting that benchmark-side scaffold with a planner, router, additional
agent, custom tool, or modified control flow makes the submission custom.

#### τ-voice

A standard voice submission presents one τ-voice-compatible agent interface to
the benchmark and uses the default τ-voice harness, prompts, domain policies,
tool schemas and results, user simulator, task set, and evaluator.

The voice system may use any internal product architecture behind that
interface, including proprietary ASR and TTS, multiple models or agents,
internal prompts and tools, routing, and orchestration. Those implementation
details do **not** make the submission custom as long as they are contained
inside the submitted system and require no benchmark-side evaluation changes.
A transport or protocol adapter that only connects the system to the standard
τ-voice agent interface is also allowed.

If you're evaluating an off-the-shelf model or voice system through the
appropriate standard interface without benchmark-side modifications, your
submission is **standard**. You don't need to specify `submission_type` in your
JSON (it defaults to `"standard"`).

### Custom Submissions

Custom submissions include **any approach that changes the benchmark-side
evaluation setup**, such as:

**Modified Scaffolds:**
- Multi-model routers, model ensembles, or additional agents implemented by
  the benchmark-side submission code
- Additional tools beyond the standard τ-bench tool set
- Modified τ-bench or τ-voice orchestration or control flow
- Modified benchmark-supplied prompts or system instructions
- A non-default user simulator, task selection, speech configuration, or
  evaluation protocol

**Domain-Specific Training:**
- Models trained or fine-tuned specifically on τ-bench domains (airline, retail, telecom customer service)
- Models trained using τ-bench tasks, reward signals, or evaluation data
- Models where training data significantly overlaps with τ-bench evaluation scenarios

Custom submissions **must** include detailed methodology documentation:

1. **Set `submission_type` to `"custom"`** in your `submission.json`
2. **Provide comprehensive `methodology.notes`** explaining what modifications were made, why, and how the custom system works at a high level
3. **Link to your implementation** in the `references` array (GitHub repo, paper, blog post)
4. **Set `methodology.verification.modified_prompts` to `true`** if you
   modified any benchmark-supplied prompts

---

## Text: Run Evaluations and Prepare Submission

### Run Evaluations

Run your agent on all domains with consistent settings:

```bash
tau2 run --domain retail --agent-llm gpt-4.1 --user-llm gpt-4.1 --num-trials 4 --save-to my_model_retail
tau2 run --domain airline --agent-llm gpt-4.1 --user-llm gpt-4.1 --num-trials 4 --save-to my_model_airline
tau2 run --domain telecom --agent-llm gpt-4.1 --user-llm gpt-4.1 --num-trials 4 --save-to my_model_telecom
```

**Important**: Use identical `--agent-llm`, `--user-llm`, and their arguments across all runs. You can use any LLM as the user simulator, but this choice will be reported on the leaderboard. We recommend using `gpt-5.2` as the user simulator for the most accurate results.

Trajectory files are saved in `data/simulations/`.

#### Banking Knowledge Domain

The banking domain requires a retrieval configuration for the knowledge base. You must include a `retrieval_config` field in your `banking_knowledge` results specifying which retrieval method was used.

```bash
# Banking domain with AllTools retrieval
tau2 run --domain banking_knowledge --retrieval-config alltools --agent-llm gpt-4.1 --user-llm gpt-4.1 --num-trials 4

# Banking domain with AllTools retrieval using OpenRouter/Qwen embeddings
tau2 run --domain banking_knowledge --retrieval-config alltools-qwen --agent-llm gpt-4.1 --user-llm gpt-4.1 --num-trials 4
```

Common `retrieval_config` values:

| Config | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `alltools` | BM25 + OpenAI dense retrieval + shell access |
| `alltools-qwen` | BM25 + Qwen dense retrieval + shell access |
| `terminal_use` | Agent navigates the knowledge base via shell commands (grep, cat, find, etc.) |
| `openai_embeddings` | Dense retrieval using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model |
| `qwen_embeddings` | Dense retrieval using Qwen3-Embedding model |
| `bm25` | Sparse retrieval using BM25 |

If you use a different retrieval method, use a short descriptive string (e.g., `"custom_reranker"`) and document it in `methodology.notes`. The `retrieval_config` value is displayed as a badge on the leaderboard.

#### Cost Tracking (Optional but Recommended)

To enable fair comparisons between models with different pricing structures, we encourage submitting cost information:

1. Calculate average cost per trajectory for each domain
2. Include costs in USD using the optional `cost` field in your results
3. Document your cost calculation method in `methodology.notes` if using custom cost tracking

### Prepare Submission

Use the CLI to prepare your submission automatically:

```bash
tau2 submit prepare \
  data/simulations/my_model_retail \
  data/simulations/my_model_airline \
  data/simulations/my_model_telecom \
  --output ./my_submission
```

This will:
- Find `results.json` in each simulation directory
- Verify all trajectory files are valid
- Check that submission requirements are met
- Compute performance metrics (Pass^k rates)
- Prompt for required metadata (model name, organization, contact email)
- Create a structured submission directory with:
  - `submission.json` — metadata and metrics
  - `trajectories/` — your trajectory files (to be shared externally, not committed to the repo)

To skip verification (e.g., for faster iteration):

```bash
tau2 submit prepare ... --output ./my_submission --no-verify
```

Now continue to [Step 3: Validate Your Submission](#step-3-validate-your-submission).

---

## Voice: Run Evaluations and Prepare Submission

Voice submissions evaluate audio-native models using full-duplex (simultaneous) communication. The voice user simulator is a multi-component system (LLM, TTS via ElevenLabs, transcription via Deepgram, audio effects pipeline, and decision models) that requires specific API keys and infrastructure. Because of this complexity, we recommend that you **open a PR and contact us** so we can coordinate running the evaluation.

The voice user simulator is versioned separately via `VOICE_USER_SIMULATOR_VERSION` in `src/tau2/config.py`, with each version anchored to a git tag (`voice-user-sim-<version>`) for reproducibility.

### Existing Provider (Adapter Already Integrated)

OpenAI, Gemini, and xAI already have audio-native adapters in `src/tau2/voice/audio_native/`. If you want results for one of these providers:

1. Open a PR with your `submission.json` and contact us — we can run the evaluation
2. If you ran the evaluation yourself, include a link to your trajectory data in the PR description for verification

### New Provider (No Adapter Yet)

If the provider you want to evaluate doesn't have an adapter:

1. Implement an audio-native provider adapter integrating the provider's real-time WebSocket/audio API (see existing providers in `src/tau2/voice/audio_native/` for reference)
2. Open a PR with the adapter implementation and documentation
3. Contact us to coordinate running the evaluation

### Voice Persona Setup (Required for Local Runs)

The voice user simulator uses ElevenLabs TTS with specific voice personas. The default voice IDs in the codebase are Sierra-internal and **will not work** for external users. You must create your own voices before running voice evaluations locally.

The recommended approach is the automated setup script:

```bash
# Create all 7 voices (one command, uses fixed seed for reproducibility)
python -m tau2.voice.scripts.setup_voices

# Or just the 2 control personas for quick testing
python -m tau2.voice.scripts.setup_voices --complexity control
```

The script creates voices via the ElevenLabs Voice Design API, saves them to your account, and prints `TAU2_VOICE_ID_*=...` lines to paste into your `.env` file. See the [Voice Persona Setup Guide](voice-personas.md) for full details.

> **Note:** Your custom voices will sound different from Sierra's internal voices. Sierra runs all final/published evaluations with its own voices to ensure parity across leaderboard results.

### Run Evaluations

Run voice evaluations across all three core domains:

```bash
tau2 run --domain retail --audio-native \
    --audio-native-provider openai --audio-native-model gpt-4o-realtime-preview \
    --speech-complexity regular --verbose-logs \
    --save-to my_model_voice_retail

tau2 run --domain airline --audio-native \
    --audio-native-provider openai --audio-native-model gpt-4o-realtime-preview \
    --speech-complexity regular --verbose-logs \
    --save-to my_model_voice_airline

tau2 run --domain telecom --audio-native \
    --audio-native-provider openai --audio-native-model gpt-4o-realtime-preview \
    --speech-complexity regular --verbose-logs \
    --save-to my_model_voice_telecom
```

Replace `--audio-native-provider` and `--audio-native-model` with the provider and model being evaluated. Key flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--audio-native` | Enable voice full-duplex mode |
| `--audio-native-provider` | Provider to evaluate (`openai`, `gemini`, `xai`) |
| `--audio-native-model` | Specific model identifier |
| `--speech-complexity regular` | Full realistic conditions (required for leaderboard) |
| `--verbose-logs` | Save audio files and tick data for verification |

For local development and testing, you can run a quick smoke test with fewer tasks:

```bash
tau2 run --domain retail --audio-native --speech-complexity control --num-tasks 1 --verbose-logs
```

### Prepare Submission

Use the same `tau2 submit prepare` command as text, pointing at your voice simulation directories. Voice mode is auto-detected from the trajectory data (specifically, the presence of `audio_native_config` in the results). You can also force it with the `--voice` flag:

```bash
tau2 submit prepare \
  data/simulations/my_model_voice_retail \
  data/simulations/my_model_voice_airline \
  data/simulations/my_model_voice_telecom \
  --output ./my_voice_submission

# Or explicitly force voice mode:
tau2 submit prepare \
  data/simulations/my_model_voice_retail \
  data/simulations/my_model_voice_airline \
  data/simulations/my_model_voice_telecom \
  --output ./my_voice_submission --voice
```

For voice submissions, `prepare` does the following:

1. **Filters to "regular" speech complexity** — any results with non-regular complexity (e.g., "control") are automatically skipped with a warning. If no regular-complexity results are found, the command aborts.
2. **Converts to directory-based format** — if source results are in monolithic JSON format, they are automatically converted to the directory layout (`results.json` metadata + `simulations/` with individual sim files).
3. **Copies only canonical audio** — for each task, only the canonical simulation's `audio/` subdirectory from `artifacts/` is kept. Non-canonical simulation directories, `hallucination_discarded/`, `llm_debug/`, `sim_status.json`, and `task.log` are all skipped.
4. **Extracts `voice_config`** — provider, model, tick duration, and user TTS settings are extracted from the trajectory data and embedded in `submission.json`.
5. **Computes `interaction_metrics`** — the interaction-quality panel (latency, responsiveness, interrupts, selectivity) is computed from the tick-level trajectory data and embedded in `submission.json`. See [Interaction Metrics](interaction-metrics.md).
6. **Sets `modality: "voice"`** and prompts for the voice user simulator version (defaulting to `VOICE_USER_SIMULATOR_VERSION`).

Output structure:

```
my_voice_submission/
└── <model>_<org>_<date>/
    ├── submission.json
    └── trajectories/
        └── <experiment_name>/         # One per domain
            ├── results.json           # Metadata only (dir format)
            ├── simulations/           # Individual simulation data
            │   ├── sim_0.json
            │   └── ...
            └── artifacts/             # Canonical audio only
                └── task_<id>/
                    └── sim_<uuid>/
                        └── audio/
```

> **Note:** Trajectory verification is not run during `prepare` for voice submissions. Use `tau2 submit validate` (the next step) to verify your prepared submission.

Now continue to [Step 3: Validate Your Submission](#step-3-validate-your-submission).

---

## Step 3: Validate Your Submission

```bash
tau2 submit validate ./my_submission
```

This verifies:
- All required files are present
- Trajectory files are valid
- Domain coverage is complete
- Model configurations are consistent
- Metrics match trajectory data

For voice submissions, validation discovers trajectory files by looking for `*/results.json` under the `trajectories/` directory (one per experiment/domain), rather than scanning for flat JSON files as with text.

You can also verify individual trajectory files without a full submission:

```bash
tau2 submit verify-trajs \
  data/simulations/my_model_retail \
  data/simulations/my_model_airline \
  data/simulations/my_model_telecom
```

## Step 4: Create Your Submission Directory

1. Create a directory under `web/leaderboard/public/submissions/`
2. Name your directory using the format: `{model_name}_{model_organization}_{submission_date}`
   - Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores only
   - Examples: `gpt-4.1_openai_2025-01-15`, `custom-model-v1_mycompany_2025-01-20`
3. Add only the `submission.json` file to the directory

Directory structure in the repo:

```
web/leaderboard/public/submissions/my-model_myorg_2025-01-15/
└── submission.json
```

> **Note:** Trajectory files are **not** committed to the repo — they are hosted on S3. Upload your trajectory files to an external service (Google Drive, HuggingFace, institutional storage, etc.) and include the download link in your PR description. A maintainer will upload them to S3 after review. Your shared trajectory files should follow this structure:
>
> **Text submissions:**
> ```
> trajectories/
> ├── my-model_airline_default_gpt-4o_4trials.json
> ├── my-model_retail_default_gpt-4o_4trials.json
> ├── my-model_telecom_default_gpt-4o_4trials.json
> └── my-model_banking_knowledge_gpt-4o_4trials.json
> ```
>
> **Voice submissions** (directory-based format, one experiment directory per domain):
> ```
> trajectories/
> └── <experiment_name>/
>     ├── results.json       # Metadata only
>     ├── simulations/       # Individual simulation data
>     └── artifacts/         # Audio files
> ```
>
> Keep the original structure as generated by `tau2 submit prepare`.

## Step 5: Update the Manifest

Add your directory name to the appropriate array in `web/leaderboard/public/submissions/manifest.json`:

- **Text submissions** go in the `submissions` array
- **Voice submissions** go in the `voice_submissions` array

```json
{
  "submissions": [
    "existing-submission_org_2024-12-01",
    "my-model_myorg_2025-01-15"
  ],
  "voice_submissions": [
    "my-voice-model_myorg_2026-03-01"
  ],
  "legacy_submissions": [
    "older-model_org_2024-06-20"
  ]
}
```

| Array | Purpose | Leaderboard Display |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| `submissions` | Current text submissions on the latest τ-bench version | Displayed normally |
| `voice_submissions` | Current voice submissions | Displayed on voice leaderboard |
| `legacy_submissions` | Older submissions from previous benchmark versions | Dimmed with "v1" badge, hidden by default |

> **Note for maintainers:** When a new benchmark version is released, move existing `submissions` entries to `legacy_submissions`.

## Step 6: Submit Pull Request

1. Fork the [τ-bench repository](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau2-bench)
2. Add your submission directory (with `submission.json` only) and update `manifest.json`
3. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear description of your model and results
   - A link to your trajectory files hosted externally (Google Drive, HuggingFace, etc.)
   - Documentation of any framework modifications or task omissions
   - Link to your model/paper if available

> **Note:** After your PR is merged, submission metadata is automatically synced to S3 via a GitHub Actions workflow. Trajectory files are uploaded to S3 separately by a maintainer from the link you provide. The production website at [taubench.com](https://taubench.com) fetches all data from S3.

## JSON Schema Reference

Your `submission.json` must follow the schema defined in [`web/leaderboard/public/submissions/schema.json`](../web/leaderboard/public/submissions/schema.json).

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model_name` | string | Name of the model being evaluated |
| `model_organization` | string | Organization that developed the model |
| `submitting_organization` | string | Organization that ran the evaluation |
| `submission_date` | string | Date of submission (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `contact_info` | object | Contact information (`email`, `name`, `github`) |
| `results` | object | Performance results per domain |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `submission_type` | string | `"standard"` | `"standard"` or `"custom"` |
| `modality` | string | `"text"` | `"text"` or `"voice"` |
| `is_new` | boolean | `false` | Highlight as new on the leaderboard |
| `trajectories_available` | boolean | `false` | Whether trajectory files are available on S3 |
| `trajectory_files` | object | — | Mapping of domain name to trajectory filename (on S3) |
| `references` | array | — | Links to papers, documentation, repos |
| `methodology` | object | — | Evaluation methodology details |
| `voice_config` | object | — | Voice-specific configuration (required for voice) |
| `interaction_metrics` | object | — | Voice interaction metrics computed from trajectories; see [Interaction Metrics](#interaction-metrics) |
| `model_release` | object | — | Model release metadata (release date + announcement link); see [Model Release](#model-release) |

### Domain Results

Each domain in `results` accepts:
- `pass_1` through `pass_4`: Success rate percentage (0-100) or `null`
- `cost`: Average cost in USD per trajectory or `null`
- `retrieval_config`: Required for `banking_knowledge` only

### References

The optional `references` array links to papers, blog posts, documentation, or other resources. Supported `type` values: `paper`, `blog_post`, `documentation`, `model_card`, `github`, `huggingface`, `other`.

### Model Release

The optional `model_release` object captures metadata about the **model itself** (independent of the evaluation), so the leaderboard can track model progress over time:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `release_date` | string (YYYY-MM-DD) | Date the model was first made publicly available |
| `announcement_url` | string | URL to the release announcement (blog post, paper, model card, release notes, etc.) |
| `announcement_title` | string | Title of the announcement (used as link text in the UI) |

`release_date` is distinct from the top-level `submission_date` (which is when the evaluation was submitted) and from `methodology.evaluation_date` (which is when the evaluation was run).

If `announcement_url` is provided, `release_date` is required.

Example:

```json
"model_release": {
  "release_date": "2025-08-05",
  "announcement_url": "https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-1",
  "announcement_title": "Claude Opus 4.1"
}
```

### Voice Config Fields

Required when `modality` is `"voice"`:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `provider` | Yes | Audio-native provider (e.g. `"openai"`, `"gemini"`, `"xai"`) |
| `model` | Yes | Model identifier (e.g. `"gpt-realtime-1.5"`) |
| `tick_duration_seconds` | No | Duration of each simulation tick in seconds |
| `max_steps_seconds` | No | Maximum simulation duration in seconds |
| `user_tts_provider` | No | User simulator TTS provider/model (e.g. `"elevenlabs/eleven_v3"`) |

### Interaction Metrics

Voice submissions carry an `interaction_metrics` block with the τ-voice
interaction-quality panel (response/yield latency, response/yield rate, agent
interruption rate, and selectivity for backchannels, vocal tics, and
non-directed speech), computed offline from the tick-level trajectories. It is
generated automatically by `tau2 submit prepare` for voice submissions and
**recomputed by maintainers from the submitted trajectories during review** —
submitter-provided values are always replaced.

The block contains a `version` stamp, the detection-window `config`,
per-domain panels under `domains`, and the cross-domain average under
`overall`; every rate is accompanied by its event counts. See
[Interaction Metrics documentation](interaction-metrics.md) for full metric
definitions, and compute it yourself with:

```bash
tau2 submit interaction-metrics <experiment-dirs> --output interaction_metrics.json
```

## Verification System

Submissions are classified as **Verified** or **Unverified** on the leaderboard:

**Verified submissions** require:
- Trajectory data available for review (`trajectories_available: true`)
- No modifications to standard prompts (`modified_prompts: false`)
- Complete evaluation with no omitted tasks (`omitted_questions: false`)

**Unverified submissions** are marked with a caution icon and may have:
- Missing trajectory data
- Modified prompts or evaluation setup
- Omitted questions or domains

### Verification Fields

Include a `verification` section in the `methodology` object:

```json
"methodology": {
  "verification": {
    "modified_prompts": false,
    "omitted_questions": false,
    "details": "Full evaluation with standard configuration"
  }
}
```

- `modified_prompts` (boolean or null): `true` if prompts were modified, `false` if standard, `null` if unknown
- `omitted_questions` (boolean or null): `true` if tasks were omitted, `false` if all tasks evaluated, `null` if unknown
- `details` (string, optional): Additional context about the evaluation methodology

### Voice Submission

Voice submissions set `modality` to `"voice"` and include a `voice_config` object. Set `methodology.user_simulator` to the voice user simulator version (e.g., `"v1.0"` — see git tag `voice-user-sim-v1.0`).

### Text Submissions

- [ ] `submission.json` follows the [schema](../web/leaderboard/public/submissions/schema.json)
- [ ] Directory name follows convention (`{model_name}_{model_organization}_{date}`)
- [ ] `manifest.json` updated (`submissions` array)
- [ ] Contact info is provided
- [ ] `submission_type` is set correctly (`"standard"` or `"custom"`)
- [ ] **If custom:** detailed `methodology.notes` and `references` with implementation links
- [ ] **If custom:** `methodology.verification.modified_prompts` is set appropriately
- [ ] `trajectory_files` mapping matches actual filenames
- [ ] 4 trials per domain (check trajectory files)
- [ ] **If banking domain:** `retrieval_config` field present in `banking_knowledge` results
- [ ] Results verified against trajectory data
- [ ] Cost information is positive numbers or `null` (if provided)
- [ ] No duplicate submissions
- [ ] PR includes link to externally hosted trajectory files
- [ ] **After merge:** download trajectories and upload to S3: `aws s3 cp <local-trajectories>/ s3://sierra-tau-bench-public/submissions/<submission-dir>/trajectories/ --recursive --profile tau-bench-ci`

### Voice Submissions

- [ ] `submission.json` follows the [schema](../web/leaderboard/public/submissions/schema.json)

- [ ] `voice_config` includes `provider` and `model`
- [ ] `manifest.json` updated (`voice_submissions` array)
- [ ] `methodology.user_simulator` set to voice user sim version (e.g., `"v1.0"`)
- [ ] PR description includes link to externally hosted trajectory data
- [ ] **New provider:** PR includes audio-native adapter implementation and documentation
- [ ] Results use "regular" speech complexity only
- [ ] `interaction_metrics` recomputed from the submitted trajectories (done automatically by `review_submission.py`; submitter-provided values must not be trusted)
- [ ] No duplicate submissions
