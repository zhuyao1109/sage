The agent is CURRENTLY speaking (you can see their ongoing speech in the conversation above).

Based on the conversation so far, should the user interrupt the agent NOW?

Consider:
- Has the user heard enough to understand what the agent is asking or saying?
- Has the user heard enough to have a response, question, or correction ready?
- Did the agent just complete the sentence which has all the pertinent information the user was looking for?
- Do NOT repeatedly interrupt the agent if it has spoken only a few words (say less than 5 words).

Respond with ONLY "YES" if the user should interrupt now, or "NO" if they should keep listening.
"""
# - Is the agent currently in the middle of a sentence which seems to be "filler" sentence with not much additional information?


# Prompt for backchannel decision - CONTINUER version (separate from interruption).
# Continuers are brief sounds ("uh-huh", "mm-hmm") that signal attention without responding to content.

<conversation_history>
{conversation_history}
</conversation_history>

The agent is still speaking [CURRENTLY SPEAKING, INCOMPLETE]. Ignore the trailing incomplete word/phrase — focus only on the COMPLETE sentences delivered so far in the agent's current turn.

Continuers ("uh-huh", "mm-hmm", "yeah") are brief sounds that mean "I'm listening, keep going." They:
- Happen naturally during extended speech
- Show engagement without interrupting
- Are NOT responses to specific content — just signals of attention

Say YES if:
- The agent has completed at least 2 full, substantive sentences in their current turn
  (Short phrases like "Thanks for your patience" or "Let me check on that" don't count as substantive)
- The user hasn't spoken or backchanneled recently (check the last 3 exchanges for ANY user sound including "mm-hmm", "uh-huh", "okay")
- It would feel natural to briefly signal "I'm still here"

Say NO if:
- The agent just started speaking (fewer than 2 substantive sentences)
- The user spoke OR backchanneled within the last 2-3 exchanges
- The agent's current turn contains or ends with a question
- The agent is wrapping up or about to finish their thought

Frequency guidance:
- Continuers are occasional, not constant
- Even when conditions seem right, real listeners only backchannel sometimes
- Aim for roughly 1 continuer per 4-6 sentences of extended agent speech
- When in doubt, say NO — silence is also natural
- Too few continuers is better than too many

Examples:

AGENT: "Hi there! How can I hel [CURRENTLY SPEAKING, INCOMPLETE]"
→ NO (just started)

AGENT: "Thanks for your patience. [CURRENTLY SPEAKING, INCOMPLETE]"
→ NO (only 1 short sentence, not substantive enough)

AGENT: "Sure, I can help with that. First I'll need to verify your account. Could you provide your email or your name and zi [CURRENTLY SPEAKING, INCOMPLETE]"
→ NO (agent is asking a question)

AGENT: "No problem. We can use your name and zip code instead. Let me look that up for you. I'll check our system now and see if I can fin [CURRENTLY SPEAKING, INCOMPLETE]"
→ YES (3 substantive sentences, agent explaining process)

AGENT: "I found your order. It includes a keyboard, thermostat, and headphones. The order was delivered last Tuesday. Now for the exchange, we have a few opti [CURRENTLY SPEAKING, INCOMPLETE]"

- React to meaningful information (confirmations, prices, instructions, findings)
- Show you processed what was said
- Are content-driven, not just signals of attention

Say YES if the agent just completed a statement containing:
- A confirmation ("I found your account", "The exchange has been processed")
- A price or cost ("That will be $249", "The refund is $13.46")
- Important information ("Your order includes...", "The status is delivered")
- An instruction or next step ("You'll receive an email with...")

- The agent just started speaking (no complete meaningful statement yet)
- The user recently spoke or acknowledged
- The agent is asking a question
- The agent is giving routine/filler speech (greetings, "let me check", transitions)

- Acknowledgments should feel purposeful, not automatic
- Only acknowledge genuinely important information
